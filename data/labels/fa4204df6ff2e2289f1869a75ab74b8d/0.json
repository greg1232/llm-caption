    "caption": "The image shows a close-up of an hourglass with a clear, transparent body. The sand is pouring from the top section to the bottom, creating a visible trail of sand as it falls. The sand appears to be a fine, golden color, and the hourglass is placed on a flat surface. The background is slightly blurred, but it seems to be an indoor setting with some indistinct objects and possibly a window or a piece of furniture. The focus is on the hourglass and the sand, emphasizing the passage of time."
