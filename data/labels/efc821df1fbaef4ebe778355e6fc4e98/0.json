The person is wearing a light-colored top and has a clear, semi-transparent eye patch applied under the eye. The background is a solid, muted gray, which contrasts with the person's skin tone and the eye patch. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the texture of the skin and the smoothness of the eye patch."
